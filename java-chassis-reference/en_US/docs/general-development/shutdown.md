# Shutdown gracefully
ServiceComb achieve graceful shutdown through JDK's ShutdownHook.

## Scenes

Graceful shutdown can solve the following scenes:
* KILL PID
* Application automatically exits unexpectedly（System.exit(n)）

Graceful shutdown can't solve the following scenes:
* KILL -9 PID or taskkill /f /pid

## Special Scenes

* In the K8S scenario, it failed to trigger graceful shutdown when using start.sh script starting the service.
  1.script content: java -jar xxx
  2.reason: After the container starts, the main process is not a Java process but the start.sh script. When K8S stops the pod, it only sends a termination signal to the main process. As a result, the Java process cannot receive the termination signal, making it impossible to perform a graceful shutdown.


## Effect
When triggering graceful shutdown:
* Provider:
  * Mark the current service status as STOPPING, do not accept new client requests, the new request will report error directly on the client, and the client cooperates with the retry mechanism to retry other instances;
  * Wait for the currently running thread to finish executing. If the provider side has set timeout, will be forced to close after timeout;
* consumer:
  * Mark the current service state as STOPPING, do not send a new call request;
  * Waiting for the response of the currently sent request, if it exceeds the timeout period for the client to receive the response (default 30 seconds), it is forcibly closed;

## Principle
When an graceful shutdown is triggered, the following steps are performed in sequence:
1. Send a BEFORE_CLOSE event to all listeners, and notify the listener to handle the corresponding event;
2. Mark the current service status as STOPPING;
3. Log out the current microservice instance from the service center and close the vertx corresponding registry;
4. Waiting for all currently existing invocation calls to complete;
5. Close the vertx corresponding to config-center and transport;
6. Send an AFTER_CLOSE event to all listeners, and notify the listener to handle the corresponding event;
7. Mark the current service status as DOWN; graceful shutdown ends;
